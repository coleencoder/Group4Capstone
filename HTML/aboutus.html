            <p>The proponents recognize and uphold the importance of access to medicine,
                especially in a time when the threat of the pandemic is still apparent.
                It is important that Filipinos get their medicine without sacrificing their health.
                There is also the urgency of acquiring medicine. Alternatives must quickly be available
                in case the nearby pharmacies do not offer the medicine needed. Customers should not
                need to hop from one pharmacy to another to check the availability of the medicine they
                need. It would lead to their exhaustion, frustration, and potentially expose them to
                people who are infected by the virus. While medicine can be bought online,
                the proponents thought the experience of doing so still has room for improvement.</p>
            
            <p>With these concerns in mind, the proponents came up with an online portal system
                that would allow customers to view the availability of medicines in the pharmacies
                in Marikina City. They can check where their desired medicine is available for purchase.
                The customers can also buy it from the system. The fulfillment of the system would be
                of great benefit to Marike√±os and people living nearby, especially those who are
                immunocompromised or with comorbidities. It will streamline the process of finding
                and buying medicine, bringing convenience and safety to customers.</p>
