            <p>The 2019 pandemic proved that more than ever,
                a safe and convenient access towards consumer needs is necessary.
                This led to an increased online shopping activity among Filipino consumers,
                and more business owners adapting an online setup. In the field of pharmaceuticals,
                Filipinos who physically buy medicine were susceptible to the virus due to long queues,
                lack of social distancing, and increased physical contact.
                The potential unavailability of medicine from nearby pharmacies would require
                customers to physically seek farther pharmacies, further causing inconvenience.</p>
            
            <p>While big, popular pharmacies were able to seamlessly operate online,
                small pharmacies struggle to keep up with their limited means. 
                With these concerns in mind, our team came up with an online portal system
                that would allow customers to view the availability of medicines in the pharmacies
                in Marikina City. They can check where their desired medicine is available for purchase.
                The customers can also buy it from the system.</p>
                
            <p>In the world today, the internet contributes meaningfully to providing convenience to its
                users. When a product or a service is available online, it becomes more accessible to a wider
                range of people. The fulfillment and deployment of the system is a significant step in assuring
                that medicine stays conveniently accessible. Whether in the midst of a pandemic or other crises,
                there should always be alternatives available to acquire necessities.</p>
